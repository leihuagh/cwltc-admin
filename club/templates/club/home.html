      <p>We have published a new <a href="/static/club/documents/Members handbook.pdf">handbook for members</a>
        that details all the information that you need to get the best out of the club.
        It is particularly relevant to new members, but established members will also benefit from reading it. Parents of juniors should
        also read the separate document, Information for Juniors.
