  <h3>How we use cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
</p><p>
We may use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to member's needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
</p><p>
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
</p><p>
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
</p>


  <h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
</li>
  <li>
  Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
    information we hold about you corrected.
</li>
  <li>
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no
    good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
    data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
</li>
  <li>
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party)
    and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
    You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
</li>
  <li>
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.  You can also withdraw your consent, where this is the basis for our processing your data (without affecting the lawfulness of our previous processing based on consent).
</li>
  <li>
Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled to refuse requests where exceptions apply.
